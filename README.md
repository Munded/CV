## Edmund O'Brien

I am a biochemistry graduate, who after a full recovery from spinal surgery converted his career into working as a software/web developer after an intensive 12 week coding course.

## Skills

#### Programming

During the intensive 12 week course at Makers Academy, I gained experience in mostly javascript and ruby with a focus around test-driven development.Examples of some of the projects I have made whilst at Maker's<br>

- Instaclone https://github.com/Munded/instagram-challenge
- Five Minute Catchup: https://github.com/5-minute-catchup/Five-Minute-Catchup<br>
- Thermostat: https://github.com/Munded/thermostat
- Chitter: https://github.com/Munded/chitter-challenge

Although I started with minimal experience in coding, I have since worked for 2 years at FNZ as first a member of the Internal Improvements team and then one of the lead developers in the MVC department, working with a C# backbone and a React front-end.
During my time at fnz, I have worked on the direct-to-client sites and admin sites for companies such as Axa, Aviva, Santander and the newly released Vanguard UK site.

  Through my time at FNZ, I always aimed to create a common-code architecture than not only fit in with current convention but improved on the structure, allowing for a more sustainable generic ui allowing for a faster delivery and more robust implementation for our customers.

#### Team etiquette and skills

  Through my many hours of working in a lab during my degress, I have developed the skills necessary for working closely with a team to produce a valuable and useful end product.<br>
  During my internship, I worked closely with a Post-doctorate team member on recently discovered protein in order to prove it's role in the Fanconi Anemia DNA repair pathway.  My work included exposing cells to DNA damaging agents, staining them, visualising the damaging with the use of light waves and counting the damaging cells to calculate percentage of damaged cells.  I then presented my findings to other lab teams at the end of the internship.<br>

  At FNZ, during my time in the FNZ Internal Improvements team and MVC team,  I had to work closely for long periods of time in order to produce the platform in a timely fashion and at a quality that we all agreed was acceptable.

#### People and Financial Management under stressful conditions<br>

  During my time at vision express, I constnatly had to manage a variety of customers experiencing a variety of problems whilst maintaining a steady work output.  During my time there, I had to pick up a variety of skills quickly in order to keep up with the high demand of the customers, including glasses repair, basic optometry whilst maintaining an understanding of the recent innovations in the product design.<br>
  Whilst at RE Hospitalty, I had to manage a large team of inexperienced workers inorder to serve a large volume of highly demanding customers.  On top of that, I had to make sure all stocks were accounted for, tills were balanced and that the demands of the clients, back of house staff and customers were seen to.<br>
  At FNZ, there was constant backlog of financial services that needed to be implemented.  Most of our platforms revolved around offering a platform that can offer customers at products such as Isa's, Junior Isa's and General Investment Accounts, whilst maintaining a great level of performance for a very large customer base.
